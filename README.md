# TLDR;

Yet another boilerplate based on Creating React App (CRA) + redux, react-router, scss and etc.

## Intro

Guides:
* [Creating an App](#creating-an-app) – How to create a new app.
* [CRA User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop and confugure apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

Inspired by awesome `create-react-app-redux` boilerplate 👏
